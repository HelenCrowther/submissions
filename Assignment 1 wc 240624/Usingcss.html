<p class="para"> Memes are a central part of internet culture. They consist (usually) of a picture, often a well-known clip from a movie or comic, together with a caption in a particular format.</p>
<p class="para">There is always a standard sentence or piece of dialogue, with key words you can add in to complete or extend the joke. </p>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/">You can find all ye olde, derelict, abandoned memes here!</a>

<p class="para"> This is a good history of the genre, and well worth a read.  Memes only get more complicated from this point!</p>

        <h2>Doge</h2>
        <p>Much soft. Very wow</p>
        <p>Doge was a Shiba Inu with a concerned expression.  He spoke in Comic Sans :) </p>

        <h2>Weird anime meme</h2>
        <p>Unlike LOLCats and Doge, you really have to know your anime to get these right.</p>
        <p>Best to leave it to Tumblr kids!</p>
